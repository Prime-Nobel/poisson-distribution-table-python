Poisson Distribution

1. Poisson Distribution is a Discrete Distribution.
2. It estimates how many times an event can happen in a specified time. e.g. If someone eats twice a day what is probability he will eat thrice? It has two parameters:
    
    lam - rate or known number of occurences e.g. 2 for above problem.
    size - The shape of the returned array.
